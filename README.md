# Primal-Launcher-Data-Viewer
A simple tool to decode and show data from FFXIV1.23b game files. 
Original algorithm used to decode the files: http://http://seventhumbral.org/downloads.php
The algorithm used in this tool was based on the one original SU Workshop. It was translated from C++ to C# and I also made some improvements for speed and readability.
